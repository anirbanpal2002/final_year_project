# Final Year Project: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Evaluation
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental condition marked by persistent challenges in social interaction, communication, and restrictive, repetitive
behaviors. These challenges can significantly impact various aspects of an individual's life, including education, employment, and social relationships. Early diagnosis and
intervention are crucial, as they can greatly improve long-term outcomes for children with ASD. In this project, we present a novel application designed to assist in the early detection and diagnosis of ASD in children aged 1.5 to 5 years. Our app leverages a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model trained on relevant data to assess the likelihood and typicalness of ASD. The user-friendly interface allows parents and healthcare providers to input necessary data, which the SVC model analyzes to provide a preliminary diagnosis. Furthermore, based on the model's assessment, the app recommends a customized level of therapy for the child, promoting early intervention and personalized treatment plans.

## Problem Statement
The early and accurate detection of ASD is crucial for effective intervention and support. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on extensive behavioral assessments, which can be time-consuming and require specialized expertise. In recent years, machine learning techniques have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. This research aims to develop a robust predictive model for ASD detection using the Support Vector Classification (SVC) algorithm. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset that includes real and augmented samples collected from sources such as Kaggle, the CDC Autism Data Visualization Tool, and the University of Cambridge, this study seeks to identify key
behavioral and demographic features that contribute to ASD diagnosis. Additionally, the study will employ Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to optimize feature selection,
thereby enhancing the model's performance and reducing computational complexity. The primary objectives of this research are to evaluate the effectiveness of the SVC algorithm in ASD detection, to determine the most significant predictive features, and to compare the SVC model's performance against other machine learning approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forest (RF).
